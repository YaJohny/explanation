### The Big Picture

You've created a console application that shortens long web links (URLs) into small, manageable codes. It's structured into three parts:
1.  **`TinyUrl.ConsoleApp`**: The user interface (a command-line menu).
2.  **`TinyUrl.Core`**: The brain of the operationâ€”all the logic, data models, and storage.
3.  **`TinyUrl.Tests`**: Code to automatically test the brain and make sure it works correctly.

### 1. `TinyUrl.Core` (The Brain)

This is the most important part. It contains all the logic.

#### **`ShortUrlMapping.cs` (The Data Model)**
*   **What it is:** This is a blueprint for a single shortened URL. It's a class that defines what information we need to store for each link.
*   **What it holds:**
    *   `Id`: A unique number (1, 2, 3...).
    *   `ShortCode`: The generated key (like `"b"` or `"my-link"`).
    *   `LongUrl`: The original, long URL you want to shorten.
    *   `ClickCount`: How many times the short link has been used.
    *   `CreationDate`: When the short link was created.

#### **`InMemoryStore.cs` (The Database)**
*   **What it is:** A simple, fake "database" that stores all the `ShortUrlMapping` objects in the computer's RAM while the program is running.
*   **How it works:** It uses a `ConcurrentDictionary` (a smart, thread-safe list) to hold the mappings. The key is the `ShortCode`, and the value is the entire `ShortUrlMapping` object.
*   **Key Feature:** It has a `GetNextId()` method that safely generates a new, unique number each time it's called (1, then 2, then 3, etc.).

#### **`Base62Converter.cs` (The Code Generator)**
*   **What it is:** A utility that converts a number (like `1`) into a short string (like `"b"`).
*   **Why Base62?** It uses characters `a-z`, `A-Z`, and `0-9`. This gives 62 possible characters, allowing you to create very short codes from a long number. The number `1` becomes `"b"`, `2` becomes `"c"`, and so on. This is much more efficient than just using numbers.

#### **`IUrlShorteningService.cs` (The Contract)**
*   **What it is:** An interface. Think of it as a "job description" for the main service. It lists all the tasks the service must be able to perform (Create, Get, Delete, Get Stats) without saying *how* to do them. This is great for testing and flexibility.

#### **`UrlShorteningService.cs` (The Main Worker)**
*   **What it is:** This is the class that actually does the job described in `IUrlShorteningService`. It's the core logic.
*   **How it works:**
    1.  **`CreateShortUrl`**: It takes a long URL.
        *   **Validation:** First, it checks if the URL is valid (e.g., `https://google.com`).
        *   **Custom Code:** If the user provided a custom code (e.g., `"my-link"`), it checks if it's available.
        *   **Auto-Generate:** If no custom code is given, it gets the next ID number from the `InMemoryStore` and converts it to a Base62 string (e.g., `"b"`).
        *   **Storage:** It saves the new mapping to the "database" (`InMemoryStore`).
    2.  **`GetLongUrl`**: It takes a short code, finds it in the database, increments the `ClickCount`, and returns the original long URL.
    3.  **`GetStatistics`** & **`DeleteShortUrl`**: These find a short code in the database and return its stats or delete it.

### 2. `TinyUrl.ConsoleApp` (The Interface)

#### **`Program.cs` (The User Menu)**
*   **What it is:** This is what the user sees and interacts with. It's a simple menu-driven console application.
*   **How it works:**
    1.  It sets up the "brain" (`UrlShorteningService`) and connects it to the "database" (`InMemoryStore`).
    2.  It displays a menu with options: **Create, Redirect, Get Stats, Delete, Exit**.
    3.  Based on the user's choice, it calls the appropriate method on the `UrlShorteningService` and displays the results.
*   **Key Improvement:** You added excellent input validation and error handling here. If a user enters a bad URL, they get an immediate, clear error message instead of the program crashing.

---

### 3. `TinyUrl.Tests` (The Quality Check)

#### **`UrlShorteningServiceTests.cs` (The Automated Tests)**
*   **What it is:** A suite of tests that automatically verify your "brain" (`UrlShorteningService`) works correctly. You run these tests to make sure you didn't break anything when adding new features.
*   **What it tests (Examples):**
    *   **"Can I create a custom short link?"** (`CreateShortUrl_WithCustomCode_SuccessfullyCreates`)
    *   **"Does it correctly stop me from using the same custom code twice?"** (`CreateShortUrl_WithExistingCustomCode_ReturnsNull`)
    *   **"Does it generate the correct codes (b, c, d...) for the first, second, and third links?"** (`CreateShortUrl_WithAutoGeneratedCode_GeneratesSequentialBase62Codes`)
    *   **"Does it crash if I give it garbage input?"** (`CreateShortUrl_WithInvalidLongUrl_ThrowsArgumentException`)
    *   **"Does the click counter actually go up when I use a link?"** (`GetLongUrl_ForExistingCode_ReturnsUrlAndIncrementsClick`)

### Summary of Your Solution's Flow:

1.  **Start:** The user runs the `ConsoleApp`.
2.  **Choose:** User selects "Create a Short URL".
3.  **Input:** User pastes `https://www.very-long-url.com/with?many=parameters`.
4.  **Process:** The `ConsoleApp` sends this URL to the `UrlShorteningService`.
5.  **Generate:** The Service gets a new ID (e.g., `1`) from the `InMemoryStore`, converts it to Base62 (`"b"`), and saves the mapping.
6.  **Output:** The Service returns `"b"` to the `ConsoleApp`, which shows the user: `tiny.poc/b`.
7.  **Use:** Later, someone visits `tiny.poc/b`.
8.  **Redirect:** The `ConsoleApp` takes the code `"b"`, asks the Service for the original URL, and is told to redirect to `https://www.very-long-url.com/...`.
9.  **Track:** The Service also increments the `ClickCount` for `"b"` from 0 to 1.

**In short, you built a clean, well-structured, and testable application that solves the problem perfectly.** The separation into projects (UI, Core Logic, Tests) is a sign of a professional approach, even for a simple PoC. Great job!
