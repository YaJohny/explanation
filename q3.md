Of course. Here is the detailed solution to question Q3.

### **Problem Statement**

Under what angle (in radians) do the curves y = x² and x = y² intersect at the upper right intersection point?

### **Step 1: Find the Intersection Points**

To find where the two curves intersect, we need to solve the system of equations:
1.  y = x²
2.  x = y²

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
x = (x²)²
x = x⁴

Rearrange the equation to find the values of x:
x⁴ - x = 0
x(x³ - 1) = 0

This gives two possible solutions for x:
*   x = 0
*   x³ - 1 = 0  => x³ = 1 => x = 1

Now, we find the corresponding y-values for each x:
*   If x = 0, then y = 0² = 0. The intersection point is (0, 0).
*   If x = 1, then y = 1² = 1. The intersection point is (1, 1).

The question asks for the angle at the "upper right intersection point," which is **(1, 1)**.

### **Step 2: Find the Slopes of the Tangent Lines at (1, 1)**

The angle between two curves at a point of intersection is defined as the angle between their tangent lines at that point. We find the slope of the tangent line for each curve by calculating its derivative.

**For the first curve, y = x²:**
The derivative with respect to x is:
dy/dx = 2x
At the point (1, 1), the slope (m₁) is:
m₁ = 2(1) = 2

**For the second curve, x = y²:**
We can find the derivative using implicit differentiation with respect to x:
d/dx(x) = d/dx(y²)
1 = 2y * (dy/dx)
dy/dx = 1 / (2y)
At the point (1, 1), the slope (m₂) is:
m₂ = 1 / (2 * 1) = 1/2

### **Step 3: Calculate the Angle Between the Tangent Lines**

The angle θ between two lines with slopes m₁ and m₂ is given by the formula:
tan(θ) = |(m₁ - m₂) / (1 + m₁m₂)|

Substitute the slopes we found (m₁ = 2 and m₂ = 1/2):
tan(θ) = |(2 - 1/2) / (1 + 2 * (1/2))|
tan(θ) = |(3/2) / (1 + 1)|
tan(θ) = |(3/2) / 2|
tan(θ) = 3/4

To find the angle θ in radians, we take the arctangent of this value:
θ = arctan(3/4)

The angle of intersection at the point (1, 1) is **arctan(3/4) radians**.
