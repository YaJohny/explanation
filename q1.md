Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem.

### Given Information

We are given three non-zero vectors **u**, **v**, and **w** in a 2D plane with the following properties:
*   Length of **u**: ||**u**|| = √5  =>  **u** ⋅ **u** = 5
*   Length of **v**: ||**v**|| = √5  =>  **v** ⋅ **v** = 5
*   Inner product of **u** and **v**: **u** ⋅ **v** = 3
*   Length of **w**: ||**w**|| = √37 => **w** ⋅ **w** = 37
*   Inner product of **u** and **w**: **u** ⋅ **w** = 13
*   The set of vectors {**u**, **v**, **w**} is linearly dependent.

We need to find the value of the dot product **v** ⋅ **w**.

### Method 1: Using Linear Dependence

Since the three vectors are in a two-dimensional plane, the fact that they are linearly dependent means one vector can be written as a linear combination of the other two. Since **u** and **v** are not parallel (because **u** ⋅ **v** = 3 ≠ ||**u**|| ||**v**|| = 5), they form a basis. Therefore, we can write **w** as:

**w** = a**u** + b**v**

where *a* and *b* are scalar coefficients. Our goal is to find **v** ⋅ **w**. Let's first express this in terms of *a* and *b*:

**v** ⋅ **w** = **v** ⋅ (a**u** + b**v**) = a(**v** ⋅ **u**) + b(**v** ⋅ **v**)
Using the given values **v** ⋅ **u** = 3 and **v** ⋅ **v** = 5, we get:
**v** ⋅ **w** = 3a + 5b

To find the value, we need to determine the coefficients *a* and *b*. We can use the other pieces of given information to form a system of equations.

1.  Take the dot product of the equation **w** = a**u** + b**v** with **u**:
    **u** ⋅ **w** = **u** ⋅ (a**u** + b**v**) = a(**u** ⋅ **u**) + b(**u** ⋅ **v**)
    Substitute the known values: **u** ⋅ **w** = 13, **u** ⋅ **u** = 5, and **u** ⋅ **v** = 3.
    13 = 5a + 3b  (Equation 1)

2.  Use the magnitude of **w**:
    **w** ⋅ **w** = ||**w**||² = 37
    (a**u** + b**v**) ⋅ (a**u** + b**v**) = 37
    a²(**u** ⋅ **u**) + 2ab(**u** ⋅ **v**) + b²(**v** ⋅ **v**) = 37
    Substitute the known values:
    5a² + 6ab + 5b² = 37 (Equation 2)

Now we solve this system for *a* and *b*. From Equation 1, we can express *a* in terms of *b*: 5a = 13 - 3b => a = (13 - 3b)/5. Substituting this into a rearranged Equation 2:
a(5a) + 6ab + 5b² = 37
a(13 - 3b) + 6ab + 5b² = 37
13a - 3ab + 6ab + 5b² = 37
13a + 3ab + 5b² = 37
Substitute a = (13 - 3b)/5 again:
13((13 - 3b)/5) + 3b((13 - 3b)/5) + 5b² = 37
Multiply by 5:
13(13 - 3b) + 3b(13 - 3b) + 25b² = 185
169 - 39b + 39b - 9b² + 25b² = 185
169 + 16b² = 185
16b² = 16
b² = 1 => b = 1 or b = -1.

We find two possible pairs of solutions for (a, b):
*   **If b = 1**: 5a + 3(1) = 13 => 5a = 10 => a = 2.
*   **If b = -1**: 5a + 3(-1) = 13 => 5a = 16 => a = 16/5.

For each pair, we calculate the value of **v** ⋅ **w** = 3a + 5b:
*   For (a, b) = (2, 1): **v** ⋅ **w** = 3(2) + 5(1) = 6 + 5 = **11**.
*   For (a, b) = (16/5, -1): **v** ⋅ **w** = 3(16/5) + 5(-1) = 48/5 - 25/5 = 23/5 = **4.6**.

### Method 2: Using the Gram Determinant

A more direct method uses the properties of the Gram matrix. The Gram matrix of a set of vectors contains the inner products of all pairs of vectors. For vectors **u**, **v**, **w**, the matrix is:

G =  [ **u**⋅**u**   **u**⋅**v**   **u**⋅**w** ]
     [ **v**⋅**u**   **v**⋅**v**   **v**⋅**w** ]
     [ **w**⋅**u**   **w**⋅**v**   **w**⋅**w** ]

A fundamental theorem states that a set of vectors is linearly dependent if and only if the determinant of their Gram matrix is zero. Since we know the vectors are linearly dependent, we have det(G) = 0.

Let's plug in the known values and let x = **v** ⋅ **w**:

G =  [ 5   3   13 ]
     [ 3   5    x ]
     [ 13  x   37 ]

Now, we compute the determinant and set it to zero:
det(G) = 5(5 * 37 - x²) - 3(3 * 37 - 13x) + 13(3x - 5 * 13) = 0
5(185 - x²) - 3(111 - 13x) + 13(3x - 65) = 0
925 - 5x² - 333 + 39x + 39x - 845 = 0
-5x² + 78x - 253 = 0
5x² - 78x + 253 = 0

We solve this quadratic equation for x using the quadratic formula:
x = [ -(-78) ± √((-78)² - 4 * 5 * 253) ] / (2 * 5)
x = [ 78 ± √(6084 - 5060) ] / 10
x = [ 78 ± √(1024) ] / 10
x = [ 78 ± 32 ] / 10

This gives two possible values for x:
*   x₁ = (78 + 32) / 10 = 110 / 10 = **11**
*   x₂ = (78 - 32) / 10 = 46 / 10 = **4.6**

### Conclusion

Both methods confirm that based on the given information, there are two possible values for the dot product **v** ⋅ **w**. The phrasing of the question "What is the value..." suggests a single answer, which indicates the question may be flawed or expects a specific choice (e.g., the integer solution). However, based on a rigorous mathematical analysis, both values are correct solutions.

The two possible values for the dot product **v** ⋅ **w** are **11** and **4.6**.
